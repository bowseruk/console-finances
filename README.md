# Bootcamp Project 4 - Console Finances

## Description 

This project was created using Javascript to make a Console Finances App. The project had the following requirements:

* The input data is an array composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
* The solution is to be writen in JavaScript code. This should analyse the records to calculate each of the following:
    * The total number of months included in the dataset.
    * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
    * The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average (Total/Number of months).
    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
    * The greatest increase in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

    ```
