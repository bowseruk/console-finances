    <h2>Console Output</h2>
    <p>The below is the output that was sent to the console:</p>

    <h2>Explanation of the App</h2>
    <p>This project was created using Javascript to make a Console Finances App. The project had the following
      requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The input data is an array composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.</li>
      <li>The solution is to be writen in JavaScript code. This should analyse the records to calculate each of the
        following:
        <ul>
          <li>The total number of months included in the dataset.</li>
          <li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.</li>
          <li>The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. You will need to track what the total
            change in profits are from month to month and then find the average (Total/Number of months).</li>
          <li>The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.</li>
          <li>The greatest increase in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When you open your code in the browser (or look at the console section above) your resulting analysis should be the following:<br />
        <div class="console"><samp>
